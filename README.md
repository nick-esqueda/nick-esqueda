### About Me:
Hey! I'm a software engineer and I'm also growing my hair out, and it kinda sucks!

Going through school I was hyper-obsessed with music, and by the end of junior year, I realized that was a road that I seriously wanted to investigate.

From there, I began learning music production, teaching myself different software to create music with. It ended up being intensely satisfying to me, working with this massive system that requires you to put all the pieces together in the "correct" way.

During that time, I ran into a new-found friend at work that told me about a Database Administration course. I had no idea what that meant, so I looked it up on Google, as all astute and budding engineers do. From there, I discovered Software Engineering/Web Development. I caught myself saying, "hold on, this is really, REALLY interesting..." out loud, and realized that software engineering was quite literally the perfect field for my brain to exist in. It felt as if I was supposed to be here.

So, I applied to App Academy, got in, finished the course within a blink, and with massive, flying colors. That choice ended up being one of the best decisions I've made in my entire life. With the music production and audio mixing/mastering background that I have, it felt so familiar and immensely satisfying to be exploring yet another massive and complicated system in order to fit the pieces together, in a purely logical way this time.

Now, I'm at the end of that journey and am searching for the right team to work with, and to do something really really great and captivating. Hi Google pls ok :)
